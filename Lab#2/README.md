# Topic: Advanced Form Elements. Child Windowses. Basics of Working With Keyboard.
## Intro

## Completed Mandatory Objectives
* Display a dialog box on some event (ex. on clicking some button)
* Add a system menu to your application with at least 3 items (add actions to that items)
* Add a scroll bar that will change any visible parameter of any other element (color of a text)
* Hook keyboard input. Add 2 custom events for 2 different keyboard combinations (ex. change window background on ctrl+space)

## Completed Objectives With Points
* Add a listbox and attach some events when any element is accessed (clicked) **(2 pt)**
* Add 2 scroll bars that will manage main window size or position **(1 pt)**
* Customize your application by adding an icon and using different cursor in application **(1 pt)**
* Use a scroll bar to scroll through application working space. Scroll should appear only when necessary (eg. when window width is smaller than 300px) **(1 pt)**

## The application creation steps
For this Laboratory work I have bean using .resource file because I din't find out another solution to load cursor ico and icon ico.

1. Custom application icon.(My work)
2. System menu : About, Help, Clear system menu adds.   
3. Listbox. Double clicking an element kills it.
4. Hover elemnts from list transforms the cursor into sniper target;(My work)
5. Text input. Placeholder.
6. Button that appends new element in the listbox.
7. ScrollBar1 changes the border 0-255(black-white)
8. Scrollbar2 changes the maximu width of window
9. Scrollbar3 changes the maximu height of window
10. Static text(3). It updates for Scroll bars ranges.
11. On clicking exit button, appears the confirmation dialog box.
12. If previously was pushed button Ctrl and the SpaceBar, then program inits the exit.

## Conclusion
What can I say. It was difficult for me, but I managed do do almost everuthing, not in tima, but still I've done it.

I wasted a lot of time consulting Google, Petzold and other sources to find solution on loading the cursor, icon, and scrollBars. Endless I'm done with it.

I will be not lying, the whole part dedicated to listBox was inspired from Mihai Iachimovschi. Thanks to Mike.

I liked the part with creating of .ico and .cur file. Initiali I wanted to make some effects on left click down / up, but I encoutered some problems and I promise that I will make it for next Lab.

I spend on my Lab the whole weekend.
