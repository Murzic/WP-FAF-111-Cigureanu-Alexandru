###Conclusion:
It is very good when you have knowledge about desktop Applications. By working on this lab, 
a lot of thing became clear to me, taken into consideration that I'm speaking about event driven programming.
I am a little bit familliary with event driven probramming, but still I have a lot to learn. What impressed me? The
thing that the systems always waits for instrunctions and catch them, in case you have specified what to do on event
or another. I get a little stack about this huge constants, even if their names speak about what they are doing.
